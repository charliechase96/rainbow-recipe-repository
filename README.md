# Recipe App

A personal recipe app where the user can log all of their favorite recipes for easy access!

# User Authentication

This app utilizes user authentication through Firebase, allowing both Google sign-in and email/password sign-up and sign-in. This method brings the user to their own personal recipe profile, where they can see only their recipes, rather than every user's recipes.

# The Back End

This recipe app also uses Firebase as a back end database to store recipes and ingredients that are submitted by the user. This allows all changes to be persisted to the app, even on refresh and logout. Rest assured that your recipes will be there when you come back!
